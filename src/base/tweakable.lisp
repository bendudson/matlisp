;;These describe some global defaults governing the

;;these by doing a setf during runtime, it is recommended
;;that you use lexical scoping to affect local changes to
;;code (global variables are only bad if you overwrite them :)

  much of Matlisp's code is written on the assumption that
  the fields of a tensor don't take invalid values; failing
